# Password-Strength-Checker

This Java project assesses password strength by analysing factors like length, character diversity, and vulnerability to common hacking methods. It
categorizes passwords as weak, medium, or strong and estimates the time needed for potential cracking attempts. Built in IntelliJ IDEA, it demonstrates
Java programming skills and knowledge of cybersecurity principles.
